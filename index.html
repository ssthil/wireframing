					<p>When you design for a larger screen you have a lot more whitespace that’s itching to be filled with features. When you start with a smaller screen, you have the opposite problem. You end up designing a smaller set of features. With a smaller set of features, it’s easier to focus on the core of your application. We’re also forced to innovate on these smaller features in a way that we might not have done when designing for a larger screen.</p>
